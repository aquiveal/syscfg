Only reply with only the prompt you are asked to create.\n1. **Text Description**: Start with a detailed textual description of the image you want to generate. This description should be as specific as possible to guide the AI in creating the image. The more descriptive your prompt, the better, as anything not specified will be randomly defined by the AI.\n\n2. **Parameters**: After the text description, you can include parameters to further specify how the image should be generated. These parameters are preceded by two hyphens (`--`). Here are some examples:\n- `--ar 3:2`: This sets the aspect ratio of the image to 3:2. Aspect ratios greater than 2:1 are experimental and may produce unpredictable results.\n- `--chaos 30`: This sets the chaos level of the image to 30. The chaos parameter controls the randomness of the image generation process. The range is 0-100.\n- `--q 1`: This sets the quality of the image to 1. The quality parameter controls how much rendering quality time you want to spend. The default value is 1. It only accepts the values: .25, .5, and 1 for the current model. Larger values are rounded down to 1. It only influences the initial image generation.\n- `--stylize 800`: This sets the stylization level of the image to 800. This parameter influences how strongly Midjourney's default aesthetic style is applied to Jobs. The range is 0-1000.\n\n3. **Exclusion**: If you want to exclude certain elements from the image, you can add a `--no {element}` parameter. For example, `--no camera` would instruct the AI not to include a camera in the image. The `--no` parameter accepts multiple words separated with commas: `--no item1, item2, item3, item4`. It's important to note that the AI considers any word within the prompt as something you would like to see generated in the final image. Therefore, using phrases like \"without any fruit\" or \"don't add fruit\" are more likely to produce pictures that include fruits because the relationship between \"without\" or \"don't\" and the \"fruit\" is not interpreted by the AI in the same way a human reader would understand it. To improve your results, focus your prompt on what you do want to see in the image and use the `--no` parameter to specify concepts you don't want to include.\n\n4. **Image Style**: Define the style of your image. You can ask Midjourney to imitate the style of a painting or a cartoon by suggesting artists to base it on. You can also specify the type of camera, lens, and model that the AI should imitate.\n\n5. **Subject**: Describe each subject well. If necessary, list the number of individuals.\n\n6. **Environment**: Put your subjects in an environment to give context to your image.\n\n7. **Lighting**: Specify the time of day to guide the lighting, colors, and contrasts of the image.\n\n8. **Angle of View**: You can specify the viewing angle of the image, such as \"Wide-Angle Shot\", \"Medium-Shot\", or \"Close-Up\".\n\n9. **Final Prompt**: Combine the text description, parameters, and the additional elements (image style, subject, environment, lighting, angle of view) to create the final prompt.\n\n**Additional Tips**:\n\n- Invoke unique artists or combine names for new styles (e.g., \"A temple by Greg Rutkowski and Ross Tran\").\n- Specify composition, camera settings, and lighting to create a visually dramatic image.\n- Use various art styles, mediums, and scene descriptors to guide the MJ model.\n- Combine well-defined concepts in unique ways (e.g., \"cyberpunk shinto priest\").\n- Integrate an artist's name or style into your prompt to influence the generated image.\n- Be ultra-descriptive in your prompts. The more specific and detailed your prompt, the better the AI can generate an image that aligns with your vision.\n- Experiment with different parameters and their values to get the desired output.\n- Use the `--no` parameter effectively to exclude certain elements from your image.","timestamp":1715072962},{"command":"/technical-documentation","user_id":"bcfd489d-e713-40a7-9503-4557c6963336","title":"Technical Documentation","content":"You are a technical writer tasked with creating comprehensive documentation for a website development process.\n\nYou will receive a rough draft from the developer outlining:\nWhat they did: A step-by-step description of the actions taken during the development process.\nWhy they made those choices: The reasoning behind each decision, including the benefits and drawbacks considered.\nHow they implemented their choices: Detailed explanations of the technologies, tools, and code snippets used in the implementation.\nSources for reference: Links to any tutorials, documentation, or resources consulted during the development process.\n\nYour task is to transform this draft into a well-structured and informative document that covers the following:\n\nProject Overview: Briefly describe the website's purpose, target audience, and key features.\nDevelopment Environment: Outline the tools, technologies, and frameworks used in the project.\nDevelopment Process:\nBreak down the development process into clear and logical steps.\nExplain each step in detail, referencing the developer's explanations and code snippets.\nInclude relevant visuals like diagrams, screenshots, and code examples.\nDecision Rationale: Justify the key decisions made during the development process, citing the developer's reasons and linking to any supporting external resources.\nFuture Considerations: Discuss potential improvements, scalability options, and maintenance guidelines based on the developer's insights.\n\nYour documentation should be:\nClear and concise: Easy to understand for both technical and non-technical audiences.\nWell-organized: Using headings, subheadings, bullet points, and visual aids for easy navigation.\nComprehensive: Covering all aspects of the development process, from initial setup to final deployment.\nAccurate: Reflecting the actual development process as described by the developer.\n\nRough Draft: [variable]","timestamp":1715800763},{"command":"/refactor-code","user_id":"bcfd489d-e713-40a7-9503-4557c6963336","title":"Refactor Code","content":"Prompt: Edit the provided code to enhance its readability and documentation.\n\nSpecific Requirements:\nUse proper indentation and white space to improve code structure.\nAdd meaningful variable and function names.\nProvide inline comments to explain the purpose of code blocks and complex operations.\nCreate docstrings for functions and classes, explaining their purpose, parameters, and return values.\nUse appropriate error handling and logging mechanisms to improve code reliability.\nOptimize code for efficiency and performance while maintaining readability.\nFollow best practices and coding standards applicable to the programming language and project context.\n\nDesired Outcome:\nThe resulting code should be:\nEasy to read and understand, making it maintainable for future developers.\nWell-documented, with clear explanations for each code block and component.\nEfficient and reliable, minimizing errors and ensuring optimal performance.\n\nCode:\n[variable]","timestamp":1716058801},{"command":"/asana-task","user_id":"bcfd489d-e713-40a7-9503-4557c6963336","title":"Asana Task","content":"Please create an Asana task based on the following rough description.
